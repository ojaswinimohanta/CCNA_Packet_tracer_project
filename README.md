🛠 Next Steps & Future Improvements
🔹 1. Adding Network Security Features.
Configure Port Security on access switches.

Implement ACLs (Access Control Lists) for traffic filtering.

Enable 802.1X Authentication for endpoint security.

🔹 2. Implementing Advanced Routing.
Use OSPF or EIGRP instead of just static routing.

Configure Route Summarization to optimize performance.

Implement BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for WAN .

🔹 3. Network Monitoring & Automation.
Setup SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) for monitoring.

Implement Syslog & NetFlow for traffic analysis.

Try Python & Ansible for network automation.
